    - [ ] If previously unliked:
      - [x] The like count on the playlist tile should increase by 1.
      - [ ] There should be visual feedback (such as the heart turning a different color) to show that the playlist has been liked by the user.
    - [ ] If previously liked:
      - [x] The like count on the playlist tile should decrease by 1.
      - [ ] There should be visual feedback (such as the heart turning a different color) to show that the playlist has been unliked by the user.

      - [x] a playlist with a like count of 0

    - For example, navigating to the all playlists page and then back to the featured playlist page should result in a new random playlist being displayed
    - Note that because your algorithm will not be truly random, it is possible that the same playlist will feature twice in a row. 
    - [ ] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please show yourself refreshing the featured page more than once. 
  - [x] Application includes a navigation bar or some other mechanism such that users can navigate to the page with all playlists from the featured page and vice versa without using the browser's back and forward buttons.

      - **Note:** You will not be graded on the implementation of this optional subfeature to keep your grade of this stretch feature independent of your implementation of other stretch features.

  - [ ] Selecting a sort option should result in a reordering based on the selected sort while maintaining a grid view.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics in the lab really helped, but implementing javascript was relatively harder to do because it initally seemed a bit complex

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have worked more on my CSS style and the stretch features, like editing, deleting and adding a new card when a new playlist is created. For now you can just input data but it cannot create a playlist/card

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Creating the header and other elements in the HTML file went really well. It was easier to implement. However I struggles with Javascript a bit. I think next time I would do more research and go over the requirements better so that I can allocate time well to work on the project
